- product SKU has the same trend as the sales_by_sku table, i.e. numerical ones have no orders or any in stock
- Several product names have a space in the front of the text field
	*TO DO: to clean up by stripping the spaces at the beginning and end
- All products with numerical SKUs have an updated alphanumerical SKU except for the following:
	- Women's Short Sleeve Hero Tee Sky Blue 9184720
	- Women's Softshell Jacket Black/Grey 9182778
	- Women's Yoga Jacket Black 9182502
